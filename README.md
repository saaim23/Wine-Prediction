# Wine-Prediction
We developed a machine learning model using Python to predict wine quality. The model was trained on a dataset of red wine samples with 11 features. We used a Random Forest model for prediction. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics. The project could help improve wine production processes and product quality.
